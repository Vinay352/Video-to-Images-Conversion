# Video-to-Images-Conversion
This program uses OpenCV to capture every frame of any recorded video and save it as an image file (.jpg). 

This program can be used to create an image dataset from a video for purposes like deep learning. You do not need to go on the internet and do the tedious task of finding images for the particular task. Thousands of images can be created with just a 3 minute video, provided that video should focus on that particular object whose images you are looking for on the internet.

This script saves immense amount of time as well as unnecessary effort.
