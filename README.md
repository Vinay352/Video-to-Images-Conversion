# Video-to-Images-Conversion
This program uses OpenCV to capture every frame of any recorded video and save it as an image file (.jpg). 

### Input
The program uses command line arguments for input parameters. Steps to follow to execute this script:-
    1) Open the command prompt.
    2) Navigate to the folder where you have saved this program.
    >> cd (path to the VideoToImages.py file)
    3) Type:-
    >> python VideoToImages.py -i (path to the video file to be processed) -o (path to the output file where the images are to be saved)
    4) Wait for the program to finish.

### What it does?
This program can be used to create an image dataset from a video for purposes like deep learning. You do not need to go on the internet and do the tedious task of finding images for the particular task. Thousands of images can be created with just a 3 minute video, provided that video should focus on that particular object whose images you are looking for on the internet.

### Benefits
This script saves immense amount of time as well as unnecessary effort.

### Sample Output
The output folder contains the some of the inital images that I had extracted from a random episode of the famous american sitcom FRIENDS.
